GAME MECHANIC AND SYSTEM IDEAS

Encumbrance System:
- Player has a maximum carrying capacity
- There is an encumbrance threshold that is a set amount of weight below max capacity
- The encumbrance debuff scales with how far past the threshold you are until you reach max capacity with full debuff
- Dynamic debuffing rates:
    - For example: Jumping is debuffed faster than walk speed
        - Being slightly encumbered may make some jumps impossible/difficult but movement is still near max
        - Nearly at max encumbrance, you stop being able to jump altogether, limiting navigation

Two-Weapon System:
- Inspired by the Two-Weapon System of classic Halo games
- Can only carry two weapons at maximum at all times
- Can additionally carry a single melee weapon and limited utilities like grenades and handheld devices

Journaling System:
- Shows active and completed Quests/Objectives
- Shows a log of all logged activity (who you talked to, what items you found, etc.)

Weapon Crafting and Upgrading:
- Sort of inspired by Tomb Raider
- Collect items that can be used to upgrade base weapons or craft new weapons
- Use a "Workshop Bench" to perform upgrades

Level Secrets:
- Doom and classic puzzle game inspired
- Find items, perform tasks, or solve puzzles to gain access to additional content
